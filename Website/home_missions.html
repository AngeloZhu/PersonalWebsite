        <h2>Summer 2018 Meditations</h2>

        <h3>Time</h3>
            <div class="meditations">“So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31).
<br>
<p>A very simple, yet conflicting verse. In all instances of my new life, I am called to be conscientious of how God is being glorified. Whether I am bowing in prayer or indulging in entertainment, how is He being honored?</p>
                <p>Sure it is legalistic to call every episode of Netflix that I watch by myself sin. It is harmless entertainment with content that is not capable of leading me to sin or distorting my biblical view of the world. Indeed it is lawful, but how is it helpful? Yes, it can be considered rest. Yes, this summer can be a blessed “season of rest.” Yes, my friends are doing the same thing. But where are my desires? What have I resolved to do in this new life? Where do I draw the line for how much rest I need?</p>
                <p>As I enter into the new school year, I have resolved to be an excellent worker for the Lord. With so many new opportunities to serve, love, and disciple, I hope that my rest will be limited. “Therefore let us go to him outside the camp and bear the reproach he endured. For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come” (Hebrews 13:13-14). I hope that my desire to love the Lord and build up the church for the city that is to come will be reflected through my zeal to serve Him.</p>

        <h3>Sovereign Grace</h3>
        <div class="meditations"><p>Sovereign grace. I once understood this phrase as a cool name for a Christian band, but now it sparks scattered thoughts about the awesome character of God. So scattered that it takes an essay to try to gather these thoughts about the glorious Creator.</p>

<p>God’s sovereignty simply means that all things are under his control. He uses his sovereignty to execute his will - to display his glory in Creation. “For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities - all things were created through him and for him” (Colossians 1:16). All things were created through [Christ] and for [Christ]. Within the chief goal to display his glory, God predestined saints to be saved to praise his glorious grace. (Ephesians 1:6). Even more, God’s sovereignty over evil shows his glory. He created all things, including the “rulers and authorities” mentioned in Colossians 1:16 and described again in Ephesians 6 as the demonic forces. It can also be noted that God allowed Satan to orchestrate temptation onto Job, but did not permit Job’s utter destruction. Truly, he has grace on whom he has grace and shows mercy to who he wants (Romans 9:15). Why? So that he may be glorified through redeemed saints and vessels of wrath (Romans 9:22-23). God is also sovereign over sin. That is, he does not cause his creation to sin, but he has the ultimate hand in all things, including sin. He hardened Pharaoh’s heart for his greater glory - that is to proclaim his name through all the miraculous works he did through Israel’s exodus from Egypt and on (Romans 9:17). Though God hardened Pharaoh’s heart, he, in his holy and righteous nature, does not himself tempt or cause anyone to sin (James 1:13). God is sovereign over Creation, salvation, and even evil, all for the sake of his glory.</p>

            <p>As I learn more about the sovereign aspect of God, his grace brings me in greater awe. The definition of grace contradicts all ideas of earning grace through works. Grace is defines a saint’s life. Before I even get to “by grace you have been saved through faith…”, I must remember to reflect on my existence itself. By grace, my Creator created me. Furthermore, in the midst of my death in sin and ignorance to him, he saved me that I might fellowship with Him who gives makes this current life worthy to be lived. Through him, at this current state I have ultimate purpose and delight. Even more, there is hope in the eternal dwelling with Him. Grace. By what authority did I force God to create me? What good work have I done to save myself? Even my faith for salvation is grace based. The Spirit blows where it wills, just as God gives grace to who he wills (John 3:8).</p>

<p>Sovereign grace. God created all things, controls all things, and plans all things for the sake of his glory. Whether it be through judgment or grace, he is glorified. My life now is a testament of grace so let me not boast for it is unreasonable and deceptive. O Lord, through future grace help me respond reasonably in faith to the past and present grace that I have received that you may be glorified through my obedience. Help me to hold on to the truth of your sovereign purpose for grace that the fight against pride may be fought well.</p>
